- **Option 1:** Download and install [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) with MinGW compiler.
- **Option 2:** Install [Turbo C++](https://turboc.codeplex.com/) (legacy interface).
- **Option 3:** Use [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) via CMD or PowerShell.

### ‚úÖ Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

To compile:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

### ‚úÖ macOS

Install Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then compile:
